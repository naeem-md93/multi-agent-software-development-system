# AI Coding Assistant

The AI Coding Assistant is a sophisticated tool designed to manage coding projects efficiently. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning models to provide intelligent support to developers. Key features include project management, real-time file indexing, and interactive user queries handled by a language model.

## Latest Features

- **Enhanced Project Management**: The `ProjectManager` class now supports more robust project file management, including periodic indexing of project files, updating summaries, and handling user queries.
- **Improved Language Models**: New classes like `NovitaAILLM` and `TogetherAILLM` have been added to enhance the interaction with different language models, improving the accuracy and relevance of responses.
- **Dynamic File Indexing**: The `is_project_file_need_indexing` function has been updated to more accurately determine which files need to be indexed based on their modification status.
- **Advanced Query Handling**: The `respond_user` function now incorporates a more comprehensive approach to generating responses, integrating project summaries and relevant data for better context-aware assistance.
- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: The `retrieve_relevant_data` function has been optimized to quickly fetch the most relevant data from a database based on query embeddings, enhancing the speed and efficiency of information retrieval.
- **Improved File Operations**: The `FileManager` class has been enhanced to better handle file operations such as reading, extracting entities, and managing file content.

These updates significantly improve the functionality and usability of the AI Coding Assistant, making it a more powerful tool for developers working on complex projects.
