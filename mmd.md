{
  "reasoning": "The project involves building a Python script that automates the generation of branded merchandise templates by analyzing client websites. The tasks are divided into logical modules: website analysis, AI integration, and template generation. Each module has dependencies that must be addressed sequentially. For example, extracting website data is a prerequisite for AI-based analysis, and both are prerequisites for template generation. Initial tasks focus on setting up the environment and basic functionality, followed by progressively more complex tasks like AI integration and template creation.",
